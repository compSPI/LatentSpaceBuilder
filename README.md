# LatentSpaceBuilder

The Latent Space Builder builds the latent space for an image dataset. 

## Getting started

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/compSPI/LatentSpaceBuilder.git
```

Change the current working directory to the root of this repository.

```bash
cd /path/to/LatentSpaceBuilder
```

Create the Python environment that has the dependencies required to run the code.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment.
```bash
conda activate latent_space_builder
```

Install the kernel.
