# LatentSpaceBuilder

The Latent Space Builder builds the latent space for an image dataset. 

## Downloading the code

This command is used to download the code on your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/compSPI/LatentSpaceBuilder.git
```

## Installing the code on your computer

This command is used to install the code on your computer.

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Installing the code on Jupyter Notebook

These commands are used to install the code on Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
cd /path/to/LatentSpaceBuilder
conda env create compSPI/compSPI
conda activate compSPI
python -m ipykernel install --user --name compSPI --display-name "Python (compSPI)"
```

## Running the code in Jupyter Notebook

The following commands are used to run the code in Jupyter Notebook.

Start Jupyter Notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook 
```

Open the tutorial notebook ```latent_space_builder.ipynb``` and change the Python kernel to ```compSPI```.

Find the following line in the notebook:

```python
dataset_file = '../data/cspi_synthetic_dataset_diffraction_patterns_1024x1040.hdf5'
```

Set the variable ```dataset_file``` to an HDF5 file containing the dataset.

Run the notebook.

## Building the Conda code package

The following command is used to build the Conda code package.

```bash
cd LatentSpaceBuilder
conda build .
```

## Uploading the code package to the compSPI organization in Anaconda Cloud

While the command to build the code package (`conda build .`) is running, you should see a line that looks like:

(on Mac OSX)
```bash 
Processing '/Users/${USER}/opt/anaconda3/conda-bld/osx-64/latent-space-builder-0.0.1-py37_0.tar.bz2'
```

This location contains the built code package. To upload this code package to the compSPI organization in Anaconda Cloud, run the following command.

```bash
anaconda upload --user compSPI '/Users/${USER}/opt/anaconda3/conda-bld/osx-64/latent-space-builder-0.0.1-py37_0.tar.bz2'
```
